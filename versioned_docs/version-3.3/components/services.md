Every process that is launched by CloudNet is called a service. It can be a Minecraft proxy or server.
They consist of [tasks](tasks.md), but the task doesn't have to be permanent.
So you can also create a new service without having to create a new permanent task.  
To create a service based on a permanent task, use the `create by TASK AMOUNT` [command](../commands/create.md),
add `--start` to start the service directly.
You can find the commands corresponding to services [here](../commands/service.md)
