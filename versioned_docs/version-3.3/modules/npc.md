The CloudNet NPC module allows spawning of fake-players for server selection.  
![CloudNet-NPC-Module-Example.png](img/CloudNet-NPC-Module-Example.png)  
Every NPC provides server connect methods either trough an inventory or through direct connect. NPCs can be managed with the `/cloudnpc` command.

## NPC properties {#npc-properties}
Every NPC consists of the following properties, which can either be set on creation, or can be edited with the `/cloudnpc edit` command.
```
targetGroup ------------- The group services must have to make joining over the NPC possible
skinOwnerName ----------- The name of the minecraft profile the NPCs' textures will be fetched from (this is only done once, the skin won't change)
itemInHand -------------- The name of the Bukkit Material the NPC will hold in his main hand
shouldLookAtPlayer ------ If the NPC should look at the player
shouldImitatePlayer ----- If the NPC should imitate the player (attack animation and sneaking)
infoLine ---------------- The hologram which is shown above the NPC
rightClickAction -------- The action which will be executed when a player right-clicks the NPC
leftClickAction --------- The action which will be executed when a player left-clicks the NPC
Available actions are OPEN_INVENTORY, DIRECT_CONNECT_HIGHEST_PLAYERS, DIRECT_CONNECT_LOWEST_PLAYERS, DIRECT_CONNECT_RANDOM and NOTHING
```
Placeholders for the InfoLine:
```
%group% | %g% -------------- The targetGroup of the NPC
%online_players% | %o_p& --- The total amount of players which are only on services of the NPC targetGroup
%max_players% | %m_p& ------ The total amount of max players from all services of the NPC targetGroup
%online_servers% | %o_s% --- The amount of servers of the NPC targetGroup which are online
```

## NPC Inventory {#npc-inventory}
:::caution Warning
The inventory contains 1.13+ items in the default configuration!  
If you do not change them, they will not be visible on versions below that.  
You can also use our [Sample Configuration for 1.8 to 1.12](#sample-configuration-18-to-112).

## LabyMod emotes {#labymod-emotes}
The module does also offer the possibility to play emotes on the NPCs for LabyMod users. This can be configured in the config of the NPC module.
```json
        "labyModEmotes": {
          "emoteIds": [
            2,
            3,
            49
          ],
          "onJoinEmoteIds": [
            4,
            20
          ],
          "minEmoteDelayTicks": 400,
          "maxEmoteDelayTicks": 600,
          "playEmotesSynchronous": false
        }
```
```
emoteIds ---------------- A list of LabyMod emote ids which will be played randomly
minEmoteDelayTicks ------ The minimum amount of time (in ticks) between the emote-play-sequences
maxEmoteDelayTicks ------ The maximum amount of time (in ticks) between the emote-play-sequences
onJoinEmoteIds ---------- A list of LabyMod emote ids which will be played randomly to a new joined player
playEmotesSynchronous --- If all NPCs should play the same emote
```
For a list of all emote ids, see the [LabyMod developer docs](https://docs.labymod.net/pages/server/emote_api/).
