The Smart module extends the configurations of the tasks, it also needs the [CloudNet Bridge Module](bridge.md) to work.
It can automatically start services depending on the player count on other services.

## Configuration
The configuration is individually for each task. It can be found in the task file of the specific task in the
`local/tasks/` directory (e.g. `local/tasks/Lobby.json`).

### enabled
Enables (or disables) the smart configuration for this task. (`true`/`false`)

### priority
This defines which task should be handled first

### directTemplatesAndInclusionsSetup
- If enabled (`true`), templates and inclusions will be installed onto the service after it has been prepared
- If disabled (`false`), they will be installed directly before the service is being started

### preparedServices
This will always keep the specified amount of services created in the `PREPARED` state so that they can directly be
started without having to copy the templates (if directTemplatesAndInclusionsSetup is enabled)
:::tip
This decreases the time needed until a new service is ready to join
:::

### dynamicMemoryAllocation
Enables (or disables) the dynamic memory allocation.
:::tip
The node is allowed to remove up to the specified amount of memory in `dynamicMemoryAllocationRange`when the total
memory usage of the node is more than 50%
:::
:::caution Warning
We DO NOT recommend using this feature!
:::

### dynamicMemoryAllocationRange
How much memory might be removed from the task if necessary  
Please read also the further explanation **dynamicMemoryAllocation**

### percentOfPlayersToCheckShouldAutoStopTheServiceInFuture
This will check if the specified percentage of players is online in the service, if not it starts a
countdown (specified in `autoStopTimeByUnusedServiceInSeconds`) and stops the service when the countdown reaches 0.
:::tip Info
You can disable this feature by setting the value to `-1`.
:::

### autoStopTimeByUnusedServiceInSeconds
The amount of time to wait until a service gets stopped as specified in **percentOfPlayersToCheckShouldAutoStopTheServiceInFuture**

### percentOfPlayersForANewServiceByInstance
If the percentage of players on a service reaches this value, a new service is being created and started.

### forAnewInstanceDelayTimeInSeconds
This is the (minimal) delay between every service created by the **percentOfPlayersForANewServiceByInstance** option.
:::caution Warning
We do not recommend using this option. Instead, we recommend using the **minNonFullServices** option.
:::

### minNonFullServices
This option keeps always the specified amount of non-full services
(according to the percentage specified in **percentOfPlayersForANewServiceByInstance** online).

### templateInstaller
This will always install all templates of the group, it only affects the way task templates are chosen (by default CloudNet uses all of them).
The possible options for this feature are:
- `INSTALL_ALL` - This is the default value and will install every template of the task
- `INSTALL_RANDOM` - This will install a random amount of templates of the task
- `INSTALL_RANDOM_ONCE` - This will install one random template of the task and
- `INSTALL_BALANCED` - This will spread the templates onto all servers (one template each)

### maxServiceCount
This will prevent the creation of new services when the specified amount is reached
:::tip Info
The value `-1` disables this option.

## Sample configuration
The default configuration of the Smart module looks like this:
```json
"smartConfig": {
  "enabled": false,
  "priority": 10,
  "directTemplatesAndInclusionsSetup": true,
  "preparedServices": 0,
  "dynamicMemoryAllocation": false,
  "dynamicMemoryAllocationRange": 256,
  "percentOfPlayersToCheckShouldAutoStopTheServiceInFuture": 0,
  "autoStopTimeByUnusedServiceInSeconds": 180,
  "percentOfPlayersForANewServiceByInstance": 100,
  "forAnewInstanceDelayTimeInSeconds": 300,
  "minNonFullServices": 0,
  "templateInstaller": "INSTALL_ALL",
  "maxServiceCount": -1
}
```
