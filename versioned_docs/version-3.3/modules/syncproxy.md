## Maintenance {#maintenance}

The module also has a maintenance mode which prevents users from joining if they are not on the
[whitelist](../commands/syncproxy.md#syncproxy-target-whitelist) or do not have the required permission (`cloudnet.syncproxy.maintenance`).

:::caution Warning

Due to missing features in BungeeCord, the permission only works in combination with our [CloudPerms Module](cloudperms.md)!
