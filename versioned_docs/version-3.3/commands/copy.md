This is a basic overview about the `copy` command.  
Please have a look below for any further information.
```
COMMAND: cp <local service uniqueId | name> [excludes: spigot.jar;logs;plugins] | template=storage:prefix/name
```

## cp {#cp}
**Usage:** `cp <local service uniqueId | name> [excludes: spigot.jar;logs;plugins] | template=storage:prefix/name`

The first argument has to be the name of the service you want to copy (e.g. `Lobby-1`).  
After that, you can exclude files which should not be copied into the template.  
At the end, separated with a `|` you can set a specific template to which the files should be copied.
