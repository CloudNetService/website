## cluster shutdown {#cluster-shutdown}
**Usage:** `cluster shutdown`

This sends a shutdown signal to all nodes of your cluster.
Therefore, you do not have to stop every yourself in case you want to shut down.

## cluster add {#cluster-add}
**Usage:** `cluster add <nodeId> <host>`

With this command you can add a new node to your local configuration.  
`NodeID` is the ID or Name of the Node, `Host` the ip address of the new node.

## cluster remove {#cluster-remove}
**Usage:** `cluster remove <nodeId>`

This command removes the node with the given `nodeId` from your local configuration.

## cluster nodes {#cluster-nodes}
**Usage:** `cluster nodes`

This prints information about the nodes in your cluster.  
You can add `| id=<nodeId>` to the command, to view information for one specific node.

## cluster push all {#cluster-push-all}
**Usage:** `cluster push all`

This command pushes the local configurations ([templates](../components/templates.md), [tasks](../components/tasks.md),
[groups](../components/groups.md) and [permissions](../modules/cloudperms.md)) to every node in the cluster.

## cluster push local-template {#cluster-push-local-template}
**Usage:** `cluster push local-template <prefix/name>`

This command pushes the specified [local template](../components/templates.md) to every node in the cluster.

## cluster push local-templates {#cluster-push-local-templates}
**Usage:** `cluster push local-templates`

This command pushes all local-templates to every node in the cluster.

## cluster push tasks {#cluster-push-tasks}
**Usage:** `cluster push tasks`

This command pushes the local task configurations to every node in the cluster.

## cluster push groups {#cluster-push-groups}
**Usage:** `cluster push groups`

This command pushes the local groups configuration to every node in the cluster.


## cluster push local-perms {#cluster-push-local-perms}
**Usage:** `cluster push local-perms`

This command pushes the local permission configuration to every node in the cluster.
