## service list {#service-list}

**Usage:** `service list | id=<text> | task=<text> | group=<text> | --names`

This command lists all services which are registered on the cloud. You can filter the output with the following arguments,
each separated with a `|`:

- `id=<text>` - to filter the services by their id
- `task=<text>` - to filter the services by their task
- `group=<text>` - to filter the services by a group
- `--names` - to print just their names instead of more information on each service

## service {#service}

**Usage:** `service <name>`

This command prints basic information about the service with the given `name`.

## service info {#service-info}

**Usage:** `service <name> info`

This command prints detailed information about the service with the given `name`.

## service start {#service-start}

**Usage:** `service <name> start`

This command starts the service with the given `name`, if it exists but is stopped ("prepared").

## service stop {#service-stop}
