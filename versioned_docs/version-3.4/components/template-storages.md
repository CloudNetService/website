CloudNet allows the usage of multiple TemplateStorages. By default, CloudNet brings the `local`-TemplateStorage. This means that templates are stored in the `local/templates` directory.  
With modules, Developers can add their own TemplateStorages such as our [FTP Storage](../modules/storage-ftp.md).
